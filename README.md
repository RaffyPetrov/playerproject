# playerproject
This is my first application for mp3 player with Python and TKinter
Install the necessary library and modules: 

pip install pygame
pip install mutagen

Make sure you have pip installed and that it's associated with your Python installation.
If you're using both Python 2 and Python 3, you might need to use pip3 instead of pip for the above commands.
